Hi, I'm Swapnil Gupta  
I build full-stack apps with Go, Python, and React. Currently diving deeper into backend engineering, exploring Docker, CI/CD and Kubernetes.

Big fan of learning by building   
I'm currently exploring backend or full-stack roles, ideally working with Go or Python and React.
Would love to work at a startup where I can learn fast and make an impact early.
Always happy to connect, share ideas, or learn from others!
